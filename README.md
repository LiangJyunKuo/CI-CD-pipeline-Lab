# CI/CD-pipeline-Lab

> Stage 1 : We will provision our own virtual data centre in AWS using Infrastructure as Code with the help of Terraform. Terraform is the most popular tool when it comes to IaC.

> Stage 2 : We will configure the DevOps tool chain. Git for VCS(Version Control), GitHub for SCM (Source Code Management), Maven as build tool, Jenkins as continuous integration tool, Nexus as repository manager, Ansible for build and configuration management, Apache tomcat and Docker to host our web application.

> Stage 3 : We will learn PaC (Pipeline as Code), How to write Jenkinsfile. We will then create pipeline job(CI/CD) using all the above mentioned DevOps tool chain step by step.
